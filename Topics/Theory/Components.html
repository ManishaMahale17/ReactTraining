<!-- 10)Types of Components -->
Components are like functions that return HTML elements.

Two Types of Components:Functional and ClassBased components
<!-- we define a render() method that returns JSX, which represents the UI of the component. -->
_____________________________________________________________________________________
<!-- 11)Components type: class :with practical-->
A class component must include the extends React.Component statement.
 This statement creates an inheritance to React.Component, and gives your component access to React.Component's functions.
 The component also requires a render() method, this method returns HTML.

app.js: <Comp></Comp>
<!--_______________________  -->

import React from 'react';

class ClassComp extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
        <p>This is a class-based component.</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default ClassComp;
<!-- __________________________ -->
import React ,{ Component } from 'react';
class ClassComp extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
        <p>This is a class-based component.</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default ClassComp;

<!-- 12)Components type: Functional -->
A Function component also returns HTML, and behaves much the same way as a Class component, but Function components can be written using much less code, are easier to understand, and will be preferred in this tutorial.
<!-- Functional components are a newer way of defining components in React. They are JavaScript functions that return JSX to describe the UI. Here's the equivalent example as a functional component: -->
import React from 'react';

const MyFunctionalComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, I'm a functional component!</h1>
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyFunctionalComponent;

<!-- Difference between Class and Functional components -->
<!-- Class Components -->
1)Class components are written as a JavaScript class.
2)Class components have a state and can implement lifecycle methods like componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate.
3)Slower as they have state and lifecycle, react needs to do comparatively more work to render these components.
4)Class components require the boilerplate code, such as a constructor method and the use of “this” to access props and state.
5)Class components use the “this” keyword is used to refer to the current instance of the component which can be confusing for new developers.

<!-- Functional -->
1)	Functional components are written as a JavaScript function.
2)Functional components do not have a state or lifecycle methods.
3)Faster as they do not have state and lifecycle, react needs to do less work to render these components.
4)Functional components tend to be shorter and more concise
5)Functional components do not use “this” at all, which makes them easier to understand for beginners.
