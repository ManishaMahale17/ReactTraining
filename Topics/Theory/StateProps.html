<!-- 13.what is props and its example -->
Props (short for properties) are a mechanism for passing data from parent components to child components in React.
import React from 'react';

// Child component
const Greeting = (props) => {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
};

// Parent component
const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Passing props to the Greeting component */}
      <Greeting name="John" />
      <Greeting name="Jane" />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;

<!-- 14.what is state and its example -->
state is a built-in feature that allows components to manage their own data.
State represents the dynamic data that can change over time and influences the rendering of the component
<!--  -->

import React from 'react';

class ClassComp extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      brand: "Ford",
      model: "Mustang",
      color: "red",
      year: 1964
    };
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
         <h1>My {this.state.brand}</h1>
        <p>
          It is a {this.state.color}
          {this.state.model}
          from {this.state.year}.
        </p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}


export default ClassComp;

          <!-- Diff between state and props -->
          
          
          Props:
          1)Props are used to pass data and event handlers to the children components
          2)Props are immutableâ€”once set, props cannot be changed
          3)The parent component sets props for the children components

         State:
         1)State is used to store the data of the components that have to be rendered to the view
         2)State holds the data and can change over time
         3)Event handlers generally update state
