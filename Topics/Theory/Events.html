Just like HTML DOM events, React can perform actions based on user events.

React has the same events as HTML: click, change, mouseover etc.
React events are written in camelCase syntax:

onClick instead of onclick.
<!-- onClick={shoot}  instead of onclick="shoot()". -->
eg--->

import React from 'react'

const Eventss = () => {
    const Shoot=()=>{
        alert('Shooting...');
    }
  return (
    <div>
      <button onMouseMove={Shoot}>Shoot</button>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Eventss
