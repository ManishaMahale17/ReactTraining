<!-- Component Lifecycle -->
Each component in React has a lifecycle which you can monitor and manipulate during its three main phases.

The three phases are: Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting.
__________________________________________
<!-- 1)Mounting -->
__________________________________________
Mounting means putting elements into the DOM.
React has four built-in methods that gets called, in this order, when mounting a component:

<!-- i)constructor(): -->
The constructor() method is called before anything else, when the component is initiated

<!-- ii)getDerivedStateFromProps() -->
The getDerivedStateFromProps() method is called right before rendering the element(s) in the DOM

<!-- iii)render() -->
The render() method is required and will always be called, the others are optional and will be called if you define them.
The render() method is required, and is the method that actually outputs the HTML to the DOM.
<!-- iv)componentDidMount() -->
The componentDidMount() method is called after the component is rendered.
This is where you run statements that requires that the component is already placed in the DOM.

__________________________________________
<!-- 2)Updatating -->
A component is updated whenever there is a change in the component's state or props.
five built-in methods that gets called, in this order, when a component is updated
<!-- i)getDerivedStateFromProps() -->
This is the first method that is called when a component gets updated.
<!-- ii)shouldComponentUpdate() -->
shouldComponentUpdate() method you can return a Boolean value that specifies whether React should continue with the rendering or not.
The default value is true.
<!-- iii)render() -->
The render() method is of course called when a component gets updated, it has to re-render the HTML to the DOM, with the new changes.
<!-- iv)getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() -->
method you have access to the props and state before the update, meaning that even after the update, you can check what the values were before the update.

<!-- v)componentDidUpdate() -->
The componentDidUpdate method is called after the component is updated in the DOM.

__________________________________________
<!-- 3)Unmounting -->only one built-in method
<!-- i)componentWillUnmount() -->
The componentWillUnmount method is called when the component is about to be removed from the DOM.
